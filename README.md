<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/Cyanhead/my-team-page-master/blob/master/Img/Screenshot.png)

I created a responsive page for a product team, following a design from <a href="http://devchallenges.io" target="_blank">Devchallenges.io</a>.
You can find links to the demo, as well as to the code, at the top.

Working on this was a bit challenging and annoying, but a great experience overall. I used CSS grid and flex, so it helped me understand CSS grid better.
My advice? CSS Grid is really great, check it out.

### Built With

I built this with only

- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hhmesazsqgKXrTkYkt0U) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

## Acknowledgements

As i mentioned earlier, i used [CSS Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) to achieve the table-like look. Then using [media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp), i just changed the order, following the design.
